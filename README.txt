Run test_chess.py to test out the algorithms. You can change which players/AI you use there.
You can also call one of my functions on the board to start with a simplified board.

I also have the AI printing statistics for each state, for comparing. You can comment them out in any given
best_move method.

To make a move, type from-square and to-square, without a space, in the console. Ex: e2e4 could be an opening move for white.
